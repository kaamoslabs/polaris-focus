## How It Works

### Focus, Without the Noise

**Stay focused without urgency.**

**Build focus as a habit.**  
Over time, Polaris helps you strengthen attention in a sustainable way – supporting better work, study, and creative flow.

**Stay present, not just productive.**  
Polaris supports getting things done, but its deeper purpose is helping you stay present with your time and effort.

## Questions, Answered

**How does Polaris Focus™ work?**  
Polaris represents time through dissolving asteroids. You choose a session size, and the asteroid gradually dissolves as you focus. This creates a sense of progress without urgency or countdowns.

**What types of sessions can I choose?**  
Sessions range from XS to Mega. Each has an approximate time window with slight variation, so no two sessions feel exactly the same. This keeps your focus anchored without turning time into a race.

**Why doesn’t Polaris show minutes or countdowns?**  
Traditional timers create stress and time anxiety. Polaris removes numbers and replaces them with symbolic time, giving you freedom from minute-tracking and a calmer path into flow.

**What makes Polaris different from other focus apps?**  
Most focus apps optimize productivity through timers, streaks, or gamification. Polaris removes pressure and creates an environment of presence, not performance. It is designed as a quiet anchor for attention.

**How does a session end?**  
At the end of a session, a soft glow signals completion. Optional haptics add a gentle tactile cue, without alarms or disruption.

**Can Polaris help with ADHD or focus challenges?**  
Yes. Many users with ADHD and other attentional differences find that the visual anchor reduces time anxiety. By removing countdowns, Polaris helps focus feel more approachable and less overwhelming.

**Can I use Polaris anywhere?**  
Yes. Polaris works offline and requires no setup. Simply open the app, select a session, and begin.
