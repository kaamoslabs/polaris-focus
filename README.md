# Polaris Focus™

Reclaim your time and attention. Build attentional habits that support deep work and meaningful focus. **Polaris Focus™** helps you create space for presence, free from the pressure of countdowns and productivity metrics.

## Overview

Polaris Focus™ is a focus tool shaped by neuroscience and design, built on **Attentional Design™** (ATTEND™)—a research framework developed by Kaamos Labs. It reduces interruption, supports deep focus, and helps attention recover naturally. You can finally experience time without countdowns, streaks, or urgency.

Most focus apps optimize productivity through timers, streaks, or gamification. Polaris removes pressure and creates an environment of presence, not performance. It is designed as a quiet anchor for attention.

**Available now for iPhone and iPad.**
